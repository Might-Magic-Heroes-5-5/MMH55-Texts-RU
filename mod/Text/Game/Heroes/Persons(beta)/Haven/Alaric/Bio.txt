An excessively fanatical priest of Elrath with delusions of grandeur, after the return of Queen Isabel from Sheogh Alaric rose up as the religious leader of her new Church. In his short career, he has become renowned for his eagerness to end the lives of anyone deemed infidel, often through an excessive use of fire, as well as his absolute and blind devotion to his cause.
