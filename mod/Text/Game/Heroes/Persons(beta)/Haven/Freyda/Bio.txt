"Strike like lightning" is Freyda's motto. During her years as a student at the Imperial College of Strategy she often surprised her instructors with daring solutions based on forced marches, surprise attacks and rapid outflanking. At heart, Freyda is always impatient for the next battle to try some new twist on her favorite tactics. Though some murmured that she was promoted because she is Godric's daughter, a string of victories and exemplary leadership have silenced even the most cynical critics.
