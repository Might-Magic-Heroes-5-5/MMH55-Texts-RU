Miscengenation is a taboo subject among the Orcs. Somehow, though, the sub-species of Goblins and Orcs mingled to provide the ruling line of Goblin lords.

Goblins recognize Kilghan as their leader and are eager to follow him, and in return he always remembers to give them a fair share of the fruits of both hunt and plunder.
