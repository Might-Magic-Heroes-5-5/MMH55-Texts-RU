Deirdre was an overzealous Inquisitor for the Church of Light in the Holy Griffin Empire. She spent many years hunting Demon cultists in the Free Cities of the East on the fringe of the Empire’s territory, "cleansing" innocents and culprits alike, worried that a lapse of her vigilance would allow the corruption to spread. In the end, when she was captured and tortured to death by her enemies, her restless soul was spirited away by Necromancers who coveted her knowledge, and by a great deal of diplomacy or dark magic she was converted to their cause. It is said that the victims of her torture, both during her life and her undeath, haunt her for all eternity, granting her a limitless pool of souls for her undead army.
