Giovanni was once a minor count of the Bull Duchy, but too far removed from the ruling line to hope for a position of importance. He ended up seeking power in a different way, poisoning his way through lines of succession. While it worked for a while, his ploy ended up unraveled, and he was obliged to flee the Empire. Stripped of all the power and influence he managed to gain, he resolved to follow his sister Lucretia into the arts of the Necromancers, and this time his plans paid off. Now a powerful Vampire Lord, Giovanni controls an important region on the border with the Griffin Empire, ready to extend his influence by any means necessary.
