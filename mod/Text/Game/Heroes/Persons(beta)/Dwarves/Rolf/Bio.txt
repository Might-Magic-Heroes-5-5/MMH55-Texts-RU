Rolf is as at ease in the court as he is in the saddle. He is an accomplished courtier, a knowledgeable engineer, and certainly an adequate, if not outstanding, fighter. He is an important member of the clan, but is too politically astute to let the concerns of the outside get in the way of his political career, contrarily to his half-brother Wulfstan who seems all too focused on the outside world. To be blunt: Rolf wants to be king. To do this he must prove his worth to all of the six clans who will select Tolghar's heir, and he is ready for any sacrifice to accomplish that. Ready to require any sacrifice from his men, at least, and, for their glorious leader, they will be happy to oblige.
