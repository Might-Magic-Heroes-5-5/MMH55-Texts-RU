Wulfstan is a member of the Winterwind clan of Dwarves. He is strong, inured to the extreme conditions of the Dwarven mountains (not many Dwarves venture outside their subterranean cities), and adept of many forms of engineering. His travels in the exterior have also made him friendly with other peoples, a fact that for some more conservative elements is equivalent to being tainted. Having embarrassed the king once too often with his plain language and undiplomatic opinions, he has been more or less banished to the frontier, where he leads an important garrison and tends to the defensive structures.
