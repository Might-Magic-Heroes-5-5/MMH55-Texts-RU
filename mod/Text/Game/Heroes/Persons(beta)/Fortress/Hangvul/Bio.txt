An old and rigid rune priest, Hangvul views himself as the sole thing that keeps the kingdom on an even keel. He uses his extensive influence over the king and his court, as well as dark magics if necessary, to pull the Stone Halls in what he believes to be the right direction. While he used to be calm, measured, and open-minded in youth, his experience in the war against dark elves, during which he lost an arm and an eye to torture, changed him. He now sees outsiders with mistrust at best, and will not hesitate to unleash his arcane powers to sow confusion in their ranks at the slightest sign of agression.
