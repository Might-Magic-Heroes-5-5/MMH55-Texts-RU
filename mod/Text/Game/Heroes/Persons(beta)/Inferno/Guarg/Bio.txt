Guarg is less adept of the art of infiltration than his brother Orlando, but what he lacks in social finesse and wit he makes up with skill as a military leader and enchanter. It is said, through never too loud, that the brothers are not entirely of demon lineage, which would explain Orlando's ease to mingle with humans, and Guarg's mastery of Light magic, quite unusual for a demon. Despite those rumors, Guarg remains a popular commander, known for his blitzkrieg tactics that allowed the Sovereign's armies to claim more than a few victories on Ashan.
